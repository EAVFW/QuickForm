# QuickForms Playground

## Introduction
Welcome to the **QuickForms Playground**! This package is an integral part of the QuickForms project, designed to provide developers with a convenient and efficient environment for testing and developing QuickForms.   
It simplifies the process of setting up a local development server, allowing you to focus on creating and refining your forms.  

## Name: Playground
The name "Playground" was chosen to reflect the package's purpose: a space where developers can experiment, test, and play with QuickForms features in a controlled and flexible environment. It's the perfect place to try out new ideas, debug issues, and see your forms in action.

## Use Case  
The Playground is ideal for:  
- **Development**: Writing new code and integrating features into QuickForms.
- **Testing**: Ensuring that new changes work as expected and do not break existing functionality.
- **Experimentation**: Trying out different configurations and customizations of QuickForms.

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
Before you begin, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. This will include `npm`, which is necessary to install dependencies and run the development server.  

### Installation  
1. **Clone the QuickForms Repository**  

   If you haven't already, clone the QuickForms repository to your local machine:  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/EAVFW/QuickForm.git
   ```
   Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```
   cd QuickForms
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Playground Package**

   Change to the Playground directory:
   ```
   cd playground
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the necessary npm packages:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   This command will download and install all the dependencies required for the Playground.

### Running the Development Server

1. **Start the Server**

   Launch the development server using:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   This command will start a local server instance for the Playground.

2. **Accessing the Playground**

   Once the server is running, you can access the Playground by opening your web browser and navigating to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
   (or the respective port shown in your terminal).

3. **Begin Development**

   You're now ready to develop and test your QuickForms! Make changes to the code, and the server will automatically refresh to reflect your updates.
